Rules of the 'hybrids' chess variant.

The main idea of this variant is that ordinal pieces may form complex pieces called hybrids.

The following rules describe all the differences between hybrids and ortodox variants:

1  Prime pieces (i.e. Rook, Bishop, Knight, Queen) are able to form so called hybirds.  A prime piece
A can move to a square occupied by some prime piece B of the same color.  As a result a new hybrid
piece appears.  The hybrid can move by the same way as A either B does.  A hybrid may be also
dismissed, any piece it consists of can move by itself.

1.1  Only prime pieces (neither King nor Pawns) can form hybrid.

1.2  Equal pieces can also form a hybrid.

1.3  No more than two prime pieces can form a hybrid.

2  Pawns may be promoted into any prime piece.  (It is forbidded to promote into a hybrid).

3  A Queen moves to any orthogonally or diagonally adjacent space just like King does.  (So it is
considered as (0,1)- or (1,1)-leaper).

4  Castling is forbidden.
