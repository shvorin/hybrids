Rules of the 'hybrids' chess variant
====================================

The main idea of this variant is that ordinal pieces may form complex pieces called hybrids.

The following rules describe all the differences between hybrids and orthodox variants:

 1.  Queens are replaced by Guards ((0,1)- and (1,1)-leaper).
 2.  Prime pieces (i.e. Rook, Bishop, Knight, Guard) are able to form so called hybrids.  A prime
piece A can move to a square occupied by some friendly prime piece B.  As a result a new hybrid
piece appears.  The hybrid can move by the same way as A either B does.  A hybrid may be also
disjointed, any piece it consists of can move by itself.
  1.  Only prime pieces (neither King nor Pawns) can form a hybrid.
  2.  Equal pieces can also form a hybrid.
  3.  No more than two prime pieces can form a hybrid.
 3.  Pawns may be promoted into any prime piece.  (It is forbidden to promote into a hybrid).
 4.  Castling is forbidden.

*Note:* rules 1, 2.3, 4 are subjects to discuss.  It may be interesting to cancel some of these restrictions and have sub-variants.

A project at http://sourceforge.net/projects/hybrids/ is dedicated to hybrids variant.  Currently it
contains only a chessboard (no engine) written on python.  It is possible to play human vs. human
only.
