<h2> Rules of the 'hybrids' chess variant </h2>

The main idea of this variant is that ordinal pieces may form complex pieces called hybrids.
<p>
The following rules describe all the differences between hybrids and orthodox variants:

<OL>
  <LI> Queens are replaced by Guards ((0,1)- and (1,1)-leaper). </LI>
  
  <LI> Prime pieces (i.e. Rook, Bishop, Knight, Guard) are able to form so called hybrids.  A prime
piece A can move to a square occupied by some friendly prime piece B.  As a result a new hybrid
piece appears.  The hybrid can move by the same way as A either B does.  A hybrid may be also
disjointed, any piece it consists of can move by itself. </LI>

  <OL>
    <LI> Only prime pieces (neither King nor Pawns) can form a hybrid. </LI>
    <LI> Equal pieces can also form a hybrid. </LI>
    <LI> No more than two prime pieces can form a hybrid. </LI>
  </OL>

  <LI> Pawns may be promoted into any prime piece.  (It is forbidden to promote into a hybrid). </LI>
  <LI> Castling is forbidden. </LI>
</OL>

Rules 1, 2.3, 4 are subjects to discuss.  It may be interesting to cancel some of these restrictions
and have sub-variants.
<p>

A project <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hybrids/">hybrids</a> is dedicated to hybrids
variant.  Currently it contains only a chessboard (no engine) written on python.  It is possible to
play human vs. human only.
